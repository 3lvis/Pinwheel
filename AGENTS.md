# Agent Guidelines

- Treat Pinwheel as a SwiftUI-first package with UIKit compatibility.
- Do not add `import UIKit` to SwiftUI-first views, SwiftUI examples, or SwiftUI API call sites.
- Keep UIKit usage isolated to UIKit compatibility types, UIKit example components, or clearly named bridge/adaptor files that translate existing UIKit-backed providers into SwiftUI-native values.
- Prefer SwiftUI `Font`, `Color`, `View`, and environment-driven APIs for new package surfaces.
